During the internship, I worked on the development of
Apple.com clone in React Js, and developed 5 pages
which are home page, iPhone page, tv page, music page, support page, header and footer.

While working on this project, I became more familiar in Responsive web designing, NPM pacakages,
Material UI, Uikit.
